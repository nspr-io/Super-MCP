/**
 * Per-tool parameter-key alias map (Sprint 2 — item R3).
 *
 * The map rewrites the agent's mistaken top-level key (source) into the
 * canonical key the downstream tool's schema actually accepts (target).
 *
 * ── Stage 0 split (2026-06-16) — irreducible entries only ───────────────────
 * The generic, schema-driven `canonicalKeyNormalize` (see
 * `super-mcp/src/utils/normalizeInput.ts`, wired in `useTool.ts`'s
 * validate-before-send auto-repair) now reproduces ALL the pure
 * casing/separator entries this map used to carry (camelCase↔snake_case bleed:
 * Microsoft Graph `startDateTime`/`deviceTimezone`, the Google Workspace Gmail
 * + Calendar camelCase→snake_case sets, etc.). Those entries were REMOVED — the
 * normalizer maps the key to whichever schema property shares its canonical
 * form, so there is nothing for a hand-maintained casing table to add, and the
 * table was the drift hazard that manufactured the `limit→count` /
 * `device_timezone` failures in the first place.
 *
 * What CANNOT be derived from the schema shape, and so REMAINS here:
 *   • True synonyms — a different word, not a re-casing. Slack
 *     `search_slack_messages` is canonical on `count`; agents say `limit` or
 *     `max_results`. RebelSearchAndConversations has its own observed pairs.
 *     `canonical("limit") !== canonical("count")`, so the normalizer would
 *     never connect them. (Verified: `get_slack_channel_history` is canonical
 *     on `limit` and has NO `count` — which is exactly why this synonym must
 *     stay tool-scoped, not global; see the note below.)
 *   • Nested-target renames — HubSpot `create_hubspot_note` takes the body as
 *     `properties.hs_note_body`; agents pass top-level `body`/`note_body`. The
 *     normalizer only matches top-level schema properties and cannot synthesise
 *     a nested path, so these stay.
 *
 * Direction was verified against current connector schemas:
 *   • Slack message tools accept `count` — agents often try `limit` or
 *     `max_results` instead
 *     (resources/mcp/slack/src/definitions.ts).
 *   • RebelSearchAndConversations file search accepts `limit`, while its
 *     conversation-send tools accept `text`.
 *   • HubSpot create_hubspot_note accepts the body as a nested
 *     `properties.hs_note_body` string. Stage C added a connector-side mirror
 *     for `body` / `note_body`; the R3 entry is the router-side belt-and-
 *     braces. When the connector telemetry confirms R3 is firing reliably,
 *     the connector mirror in resources/mcp/hubspot/src/tools/crm-handlers.ts
 *     can go.
 *
 * Semantics:
 *   • Source matches by exact key on the top level of `args` only.
 *     No deep recursion (avoids accidentally rewriting `_meta` or
 *     `structuredContent` payload keys).
 *   • Replace — not duplicate. The source key is removed from `args` and the
 *     target key is set. When the target is dotted (e.g.
 *     `properties.hs_note_body`), the leading object is created on demand.
 *   • Collision rule: target wins. If the target is already present
 *     (top-level OR nested for dotted targets) and non-empty, the source key
 *     is silently dropped and a `key_alias_skipped:<from>→<to>:target_exists`
 *     breadcrumb is emitted.
