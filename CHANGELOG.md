# Changelog

All notable changes to Super MCP Router will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.4.0] - 2025-12-27

### Added
- **Tool search endpoint**: New `GET /api/tools` REST endpoint for bulk tool export with ETag support for efficient caching
- **search_tools MCP tool**: BM25 keyword search over all available tools, returning relevance scores, schemas, and package info. Enables semantic tool discovery in client applications.

### Changed
- Updated `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` to 1.25.1 (backwards-compatible spec type adjustments)

## [2.3.0] - 2025-12-22

### Added
- **Package restart tool**: New `restart_package` tool to hot-reload credentials without restarting Super MCP
  - Closes existing client connection and re-expands environment variables from raw config
  - Picks up new `process.env` values for packages using `${VAR}` syntax
  - Handles race conditions: waits for pending connections before restart
  - Next tool call automatically reconnects with fresh configuration
- New `restartPackage()` method on `PackageRegistry` for programmatic package restarts
- New `normalizeServerEntry()` helper for single-package config normalization

### Use Cases
- Update API keys for third-party MCP packages without full server restart
- Refresh OAuth tokens or credentials that have been rotated
- Development workflow: change credentials and immediately test without restart

## [2.2.0] - 2025-12-08

### Changed
- **Layered security model**: Allowlist and blocklist now both apply together
  - Previously: If allowlist was configured, blocklist was ignored
  - Now: Both gates apply - must be on allowlist (if configured) AND not on blocklist (if configured)
  - This enables configurations like "allow only filesystem package, but block delete operations within it"
- Security policy `mode` in logs now shows "layered" when both allowlist and blocklist are configured
- Blocked attempt logs now show which `gate` (allowlist vs blocklist) caused the block

## [2.1.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- **Security config hot-reload**: Security policy automatically reloads when config files change
  - No server restart required to update blocked/allowed tools
  - All config files in the chain are watched (including `configPaths` references)
  - Changes debounced (500ms) to handle editor save behavior
  - Fail-safe: if reload fails (invalid JSON), existing policy is kept
- New `chokidar` dependency for robust cross-platform file watching

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added
- **Security policy system**: Block or allow specific tools and packages
  - `blockedTools`: Block specific tools by exact name or regex pattern
  - `blockedPackages`: Block entire packages
  - `allowedTools`: Allowlist mode - only specified tools permitted
  - `allowedPackages`: Allowlist mode - only specified packages permitted
  - `logBlockedAttempts`: Control logging of blocked access attempts
- Pattern matching support: exact strings or regex patterns (`"/.*delete.*/i"`)
- Security status shown in `list_tools` output (blocked tools marked with reason)
- New error code `TOOL_BLOCKED` (-32008) for security policy violations

### Changed
- Major codebase refactoring for improved maintainability
- Handler functions extracted to separate modules
- Improved code organization and separation of concerns

## [1.6.5] - 2025-12-06

### Added
- **Dynamic OAuth port selection**: OAuth callback server now automatically finds an available port
  - Tries ports 5173-5182 in sequence if default port is in use
  - Eliminates "port already in use" errors during concurrent authentication
  - Port is dynamically registered with OAuth providers via MCP's dynamic client registration
- **Port finder utility**: New `findAvailablePort()` function in `src/utils/portFinder.ts`

### Changed
- `OAuthCallbackServer` now accepts port in constructor (default: 5173)
- `HttpMcpClient` now accepts `oauthPort` option for OAuth redirect URL
- `SimpleOAuthProvider` now uses dynamic port for redirect URLs
- `handleAuthenticate` finds available port before starting OAuth flow

### Fixed
- Fixed OAuth failures when port 5173 is already in use by another process
- Fixed concurrent authentication attempts conflicting on the same port

## [1.6.2] - 2025-11-29

### Fixed
- **Critical: HTTP mode process exit bug**: Fixed issue where HTTP server would exit immediately after starting (within 2ms) due to missing `await` on `startServer()` in CLI entry point. This caused all concurrent agent sessions to fall back to stdio mode, resulting in race conditions and tool failures.

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-27

### Added
- **Output truncation support**: New `max_output_chars` parameter on `use_tool` to prevent context overflow
  - When specified, tool outputs exceeding the limit are truncated with a clear indicator
  - Truncation metadata included in telemetry (`output_truncated`, `original_output_chars`)
- **Large output warnings**: Automatic warning hints when tool outputs exceed 150k characters (~37.5k tokens)
  - Warning suggests using `max_output_chars` parameter to prevent context overflow
  - Enables AI agents to self-recover by retrying with output limits
- **Output size telemetry**: All tool results now include `output_chars` in telemetry for monitoring

### Changed
- `UseToolOutput` telemetry now includes optional fields: `output_chars`, `output_truncated`, `original_output_chars`

## [1.4.0] - 2025-10-08

### Added
- **Configurable tool timeouts**: Support for per-server timeout configuration via `timeout` field
- **Global timeout environment variable**: `SUPER_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT` for setting default timeout across all servers
- **Progress-based timeout reset**: Timeouts automatically reset when MCP servers send progress notifications
- **Increased default timeout**: Changed from 60 seconds to 5 minutes (300,000ms) for better support of long-running operations

### Changed
- Default tool execution timeout increased from 60 seconds to 5 minutes
- Tool timeouts now properly passed through to MCP SDK for both stdio and HTTP transports
- Timeout configuration now supports three levels: per-server config > global env var > default (300s)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue where MCP tool calls were timing out at hardcoded 60 seconds regardless of configuration
- Long-running tools (research, data processing, complex queries) can now complete successfully

## [1.3.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **Zero-config setup**: Automatically creates `~/.super-mcp/` directory and config on first run
- **CLI for adding MCPs**: Simple `add` command to add pre-configured MCP servers
- **Empty config support**: Super MCP Router now works with no MCPs configured (minimal mode)
- **Auto-setup**: Creates directories, logs folder, and empty config automatically

### Changed
- **Simplified onboarding**: No manual config creation needed - just add to Claude and restart
- **Default config location**: Now defaults to `~/.super-mcp/config.json` if no config specified
- **Better first-run experience**: Helpful messages guide users on next steps

### Fixed
- Config validation no longer requires at least one server

## [1.2.0] - 2025-01-11

### Added
- **Comprehensive error messaging**: All errors now provide actionable diagnostics and troubleshooting steps
- **Environment variable expansion**: Support for `${VAR}` and `$VAR` syntax in configuration files
- **JSON Schema format validation**: Added support for standard formats (date, date-time, email, etc.) via ajv-formats
- **OAuth token invalidation**: Automatic cleanup of invalid OAuth tokens when "Client ID mismatch" occurs
- **Enhanced health check diagnostics**: Detailed per-package status with suggested actions
- **Improved validation errors**: Clear guidance on missing/incorrect arguments with schema hints

### Changed
- **Security improvement**: Only explicitly configured environment variables are passed to MCP servers (no longer passes entire process.env)
- **Better connection error handling**: Specific diagnostics for command not found, permission denied, and network issues
- **Clearer tool execution errors**: Context-aware error messages based on failure type (timeout, auth, permissions)

### Fixed
- **Notion OAuth browser not opening**: Fixed issue where browser wouldn't open when invalid tokens were present
- **Notion search failures**: Fixed validation errors with date formats in Notion search filters
- **Environment variable security**: Prevented leaking of all system environment variables to MCP servers

### Security
- Environment variables are now isolated per MCP server - each server only receives explicitly configured variables
- Sensitive values (tokens, keys) are never logged in debug output

## [1.1.0] - 2025-01-09

### Added
- Support for multiple configuration files via multiple --config arguments
- Support for comma-separated config paths in SUPER_MCP_CONFIG environment variable
- Automatic merging of servers from multiple config files (duplicates handled gracefully)

### Changed
- Configuration loading now supports both single and multiple file inputs
- Backward compatible - existing single config setups continue to work unchanged
